# Formatted-Factors
These are functions that return formatted text of the prime factors of a number.  
They use comma separators and superscripts. 


Examples:

    julia> println(textFactors!(240_051_200, primes))

    240,051,200 = 2¹⁰ × 5² × 9,377¹


    julia> print(textFactors!(nums, primes))
      
          5,040 = 2⁴ × 3² × 5¹ × 7¹
          7,680 = 2⁹ × 3¹ × 5¹
         10,000 = 2⁴ × 5⁴
         10,240 = 2¹¹ × 5¹
    143,496,441 = 3⁴ × 11⁶
    240,051,200 = 2¹⁰ × 5² × 9,377¹
          1,517 = 37¹ × 41¹
